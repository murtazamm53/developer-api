# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** 2025-09-07

Welcome to the `Api-Only-App` service (the “Service”) (“we”, “us”, “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Service, which is provided primarily as a server-side integration to interact with the TikTok API and related services.

By using or accessing the Service you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Service Overview
`Api-Only-Ap` is a server-side application that helps developers and administrators obtain and use TikTok API credentials and perform authorized server-to-server requests. The Service does not provide a user-facing client application by default and is intended to be used by authorized developers, systems, and administrators.

## 2. Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years old and have authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of the organization using the Service. You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose.

## 3. Registration and Access
- You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining any API credentials necessary to integrate with TikTok (including any required API keys, access tokens, or developer accounts).
- You must keep your credentials secure and not share them publicly (for example, do not commit them to public GitHub repositories).
- We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or applicable policies.

## 4. Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Use the Service to access, collect, or store data in violation of any applicable law, regulation, or third-party policy (including TikTok’s developer policies).
- Reverse-engineer, modify, or tamper with the Service.
- Interfere with the security or proper functioning of the Service.
- Publish API keys, secrets, or other sensitive credentials in public code repositories.

## 5. Data and Privacy
- The Service may collect logs, usage metrics, and data returned by TikTok APIs when you use it.
- Use of personal data is governed by our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY_POLICY.md).
- You are responsible for obtaining any user consents required by law or TikTok’s policies for data you request via the TikTok API.

## 6. Third-Party Services
The Service may integrate with third-party services (e.g., TikTok, hosting providers, analytics). Your use of those services is subject to the third parties’ terms. We are not responsible for third-party services or their policies.

## 7. Intellectual Property
All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service (excluding your content and third-party content) are owned by `shop and stack` or its licensors. You retain ownership of any data or content you submit through the Service.

## 8. Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data processed by the Service. However, no system is completely secure — you are responsible for securely storing and managing your API credentials and for following best practices when integrating with the Service.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 10. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, `shop and stack` WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES WILL NOT EXCEED $100 (OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID, IF ANY, IN THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS) — ADJUST AS NEEDED.

## 11. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access for violations of these Terms or applicable law. You may stop using the Service at any time. Upon termination, any cached credentials or tokens we control may be revoked.

## 12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of the state/province and country you specify (e.g., State of New York, USA). Any dispute arising from these Terms will be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction — replace with your preferred jurisdiction.

## 13. Changes
We may modify these Terms. We will post the revised Terms here with a new “Effective date.” Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
