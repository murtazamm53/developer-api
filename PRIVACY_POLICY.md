# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** YYYY-MM-DD

This Privacy Policy explains how **Shop and Stack** (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, ‚Äúour‚Äù) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you use the `Api-Only-App` server-side service that integrates with TikTok APIs.

If you are a user of a client application that uses our server-side Service, your interactions and the data collected may also be governed by that client‚Äôs privacy policy. This policy applies to data we collect and process directly as part of providing the server-side Service.

## 1. Data Controller
**Controller:** Shop and Stack  
**Contact:** sales@shopandstack.com

## 2. Information We Collect
Because the Service is server-side and developer-focused, we typically collect the following types of information:

### a. Developer / Admin Information
- Account identifiers (username, organization name)  
- Contact information (email)  
- API credentials you submit to configure integrations (we strongly recommend you use environment variables and never commit secrets to public repositories)

### b. TikTok API Data
- Data returned by TikTok APIs when you request it (e.g., metrics, media URLs, user profile fields) depending on scopes and permissions granted.  
- We only request and store the minimum data necessary for the configured functionality.

### c. Logs and Usage Data
- Service logs, access timestamps, IP addresses, API request/response metadata (not full content unless configured).  
- Error reports and performance metrics.

### d. Cookies and Tracking
- Our admin dashboard (if any) may use cookies or analytics for authentication and usage metrics. For server-to-server flows, user-facing cookies are not required.

## 3. How We Use Information
We use collected data to:
- Provide, maintain, and operate the Service.  
- Facilitate and secure API integrations with TikTok.  
- Debug and improve the Service (logs and analytics).  
- Communicate with administrators (support, notices, updates).  
- Comply with legal obligations.

## 4. Legal Bases (for users in the EEA)
Where applicable, our legal bases for processing personal data include:
- Consent (when you provide it).  
- Performance of a contract.  
- Legitimate interests (security, service operation), balanced with data subject rights.

## 5. Sharing and Disclosure
We may disclose information to:
- TikTok and other third-party service providers as necessary to perform the Service.  
- Subprocessors and hosting providers who process data on our behalf.  
- Law enforcement, government agencies, or other parties where required by law, legal process, or to protect our rights.  
- In connection with a business transaction (e.g., sale or merger) ‚Äî subject to confidentiality obligations.  

We do not sell personal data.

## 6. Data Retention
We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, or resolve disputes. Retention periods vary by data type (e.g., logs may be retained for X days ‚Äî configure this according to your needs).

## 7. Data Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data (encryption in transit, access controls, periodic audits). However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for protecting your API keys and secrets.

## 8. International Transfers
We may transfer personal data across national borders (for example, to our hosting providers). Where required, we will implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses).

## 9. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including:
- Access to your personal data.  
- Correction of inaccurate data.  
- Deletion or restriction of processing.  
- Portability of your data.  
- Objecting to processing or withdrawing consent.  

To exercise these rights, contact: sales@shopandstack.com. We may verify your identity before responding.

## 10. Children‚Äôs Privacy
The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or higher minimum age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we learn we have inadvertently collected data from a child without parental consent, we will delete it.

## 11. Third-Party Links and Services
Our Service may use third-party services (e.g., TikTok). Those services‚Äô own privacy policies apply in addition to this policy. You should review TikTok‚Äôs developer and privacy policies before requesting data.

## 12. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
If we provide an administrative web UI, it may use cookies or analytics for functionality and performance. You can configure or opt-out of non-essential tracking where applicable.

## 13. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post the revised policy with a new effective date. Continued use after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
